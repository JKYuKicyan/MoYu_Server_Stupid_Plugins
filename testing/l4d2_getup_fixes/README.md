- To install this, make sure you have removed:
　- l4d2_getupfix
　- double_getup
- And you need to install old version l4d2_charger_getup_fix, which provides godframes only.
　- Get it (here)[https://github.com/spoon-l4d2/Plugins/commit/2135f7e4b61decbbda47da3396d76d8bc9e56559]
- As the above, this is a plugin containing all the get-up fixes in a better (meybe) way. However, perhaps I still miss some points that need to cover with more data.
- Any report is greatly appreciated!
