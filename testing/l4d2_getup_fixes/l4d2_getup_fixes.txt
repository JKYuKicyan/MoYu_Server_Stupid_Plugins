			 * Double click on the first virtual function "CTerrorPlayerAnimState::ClearAnimationState".
			 * Go to its function xref 3 times, and you will meet with an enormous constructor function.
			 * 
			 * 1. Generate pseudocode and you can easily find the offset where the cursor is.
			 * 2. See the "mov" instruction below the highlighted "call".
