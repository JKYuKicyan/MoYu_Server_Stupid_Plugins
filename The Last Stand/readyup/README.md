# readyup

- Enriched the information shown on panel
- Player who cancels countdown will be shown via a chat message
- Quick ready/unready via Vote Keys _(default are **F1** and **F2**)_
- Allows voting for Force Start except full players in game
- Tidied up codes but commented caster settings server-side, which seems not much useful.
