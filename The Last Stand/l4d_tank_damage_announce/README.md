# [L4D2] Tank Damage Announce

### Introduction
- A modified version with full support for multiple tanks and better way to record last human control.
- Merged with [l4d2_tank_facts_announce](https://github.com/Target5150/MoYu_Server_Stupid_Plugins/tree/master/The%20Last%20Stand/l4d2_tank_facts_announce)
	- NOTE: Currently no option to change the text style so both damage and facts are printed together. Maybe an update soon.
- NOTE: There're some issues with `z_spawn` that prevent the plugin from working properly.
