# Restore Blocked Vocalize in Competitive

### Introduction
- **Self-descriptive**
	- Perform **Laughter**, **Taunt**, **Death Scream** _nearly_ as naturally as in vanilla.
		- Works via `PerformScene()` provided with **scene files** (.vcd).
		- **nearly** simply means since The Last Stand update, I cannot tell if certain voicelines are enabled or not, and how the new system of vocalize works.
