# Predictable Unloader ([Original](https://github.com/SirPlease/L4D2-Competitive-Rework/tree/master/addons/sourcemod/scripting) by [SirPlease](https://github.com/SirPlease))

### Introduction

Do the same, but a bit fresher.
- Used `ArrayStack` instead since we always want to unload plugins in reverse order.
- Avoided some string operations since plugin can be addressed via `Handle`.
- Alternative solution for missing plugins after unload due to early refresh.
