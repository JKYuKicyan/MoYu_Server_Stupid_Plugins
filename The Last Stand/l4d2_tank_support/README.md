# l4d2_tank_support

- 2020/11/29: Edited ConVar name
- Added convars to allow certain viewers of hittable glows

- Update for TLS: Corrected hooks (Credit to SirPlease) on hittables that "break" into separated parts when punched
- Works on new forklift, c11m4 World Sphere. Maybe widely applicable to hitables in any map.

# Convars
