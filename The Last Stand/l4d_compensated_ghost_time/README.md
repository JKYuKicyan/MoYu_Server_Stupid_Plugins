# [L4D & 2] Compensated Ghost Time

### Introduction
- Compensate ghost spawn time to catch up your teammates.
	- What exactly:
		- Decrease your spawn time to the average of your team.
			- e.g. You are spawning in **16s** while your 3 teammates are all **4s**, you get **7s = (16+4+4+4)/4 s** instead.
	- Rules:
		1. Alive player / in deathcam counts as a full spawn time (= your spawn time).
		2. Player must not leaving Infected Team in between death and ghost countdown starts (= no benefit if spectate to die).
